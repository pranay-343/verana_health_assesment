pressure reading of over 100?


5. Pharma Co. Z has a product on the market to prevent heart attacks. They want to study
patients who complain of signs of heart attacks to their doctors. Specifically, they are
interested in knowing how many patients complaining of pain, fluttering, pressure or
tightness in their chest have that documented in the notes on their record. Write code for
and provide counts of how many unique patients match this criteria. Write a short

b. How many patients with either of the two diagnoses might have experienced
those symptoms, but cannot be confirmed using this data? Write 1-2 sentences
for Pharma Co. Z about why this might be the case.


7. Are the distributions of cholesterol values different for smokers vs. non-smokers? Create
a visualization to display this.
